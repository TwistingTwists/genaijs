What is
Government?

You must have heard the word ‘government’
mentioned several times. In this chapter you
will learn about what a government is and the
important role it plays in our lives. What do
governments do? How do they decide what to
do? What is the difference between different
types of governments such as monarchies and
democracies? Read more and find out….

Look at the newspaper headlines above
and list the different kinds of activities
that the government is reported to be
doing in these newspaper headlines.

very country needs a government
to make decisions and get things
done. These can be decisions about
where to build roads and schools, or
how to reduce the price of onions
when they get too expensive or ways
to increase the supply of electricity.
The government also takes action on
many social issues, for example it has
several programmes to help the poor.
It does other important things such as
running postal and railway services.

The government also has the job
of protecting the boundaries of the
country and maintaining peaceful
relations with other countries. It is
responsible for ensuring that all its
citizens have enough to eat and have
good health facilities. When there are
natural disasters like the tsunami or
an earthquake it is the government that
mainly organises aid and assistance for
the affected people. If there is a dispute
or if someone has committed a crime
you find people in a court. Courts are
also part of the government.
Perhaps you are wondering how
governments manage to do all this.
And why it is necessary for them
to do so. When human beings live
and work together, there needs to be
some amount of organisation so that
decisions can be made.

Can you list three things that the
government does which have not
been mentioned.

Some rules have to be made that
apply to everyone. For example, there
is a need to control resources and
protect the territory of a country, so
people can feel secure. Governments
do this on behalf of their people
by exercising leadership, taking
decisions and implementing these
among all the people living in their
territory.
Levels of Government

government is responsible for so many

different things, can you think of
how it manages to do all these? The
government works at different levels:
at the local level, at the level of the
state and at the national level. The
local level means in your village, town
or locality, the state level would mean
that which covers an entire state like

Haryana or Assam and the national
level relates to the entire country (see
the maps). Later in this book, you will
read about how local level government
functions, and when you go into the
next few classes you will learn about
how governments function at the state
and central levels.

Laws and the Government
The government makes laws and
everyone who lives in the country
has to follow these. This is the only
way governments can function. Just
like the government has the power to
make decisions, similarly it has the
power to enforce its decisions. For
example, there is a law that says that
all persons driving a motor vehicle
must have a licence. Any person
caught driving a vehicle without a
licence can either be jailed or fined a
large sum of money. Without these
laws the government’s power to make
decisions is not of much use.
Discuss
Think of an example of another
law. Why do you think it is
important that people abide by
this law?

who give the government this power.
They do this through elections in which
they vote for particular persons and
elect them. Once elected, these persons
form the government. In a democracy
the government has to explain its
actions and defend its decisions to
the people.
Another
form
of
government
is monarchy. The monarch (king
or queen) has the power to make
decisions and run the government.
The monarch may have a small group
of people to discuss matters with,
but the final decision-making power
remains with the monarch. Unlike in
a democracy, kings and queens do not
have to explain their actions or defend
the decisions they take.

In addition to any actions that
governments can take, there are also
steps that people can take if they
feel that a particular law is not being
followed. If a person feels, for example,
that they were not hired for a job
because of their religion or caste, he or
she may approach the court and claim
that the law is not being followed. The
court can then give orders about what
should be done.
Types of Government
Who gives the government this power to
make decisions and enforce laws?
The answer to this question depends
on the type of government there is in a
country. In a democracy it is the people

for people to be involved in
decisions that affect them? Give
two reasons for your answer.
2. Which type of government
would you prefer to have in the
place you live in? Why?

citizens are allowed to elect
whomever they want.
b. In a democracy a king has
absolute powers to rule the
country.
c. In a monarchy people
can raise questions about the
decisions the monarch takes.

Democratic Governments
India is a democracy. This achievement
is the result of a long and eventful
struggle of the Indian people. There are
other places in the world where people
have also struggled to have democracies.
You now know that the main feature
of a democracy is that the people have
the power to elect their leaders. So in
a sense a democracy is rule by the
people. The basic idea is that people
rule themselves by participating in the
making of these rules.
Democratic governments in our
times are usually referred to as
representative
democracies.
In
representative democracies people do
not participate directly but, instead,
choose their representatives through an

and

Women’s
struggle to vote got
strengthened
during
the First World War. This movement is
called the women’s suffrage movement
as the term suffrage usually means
right to vote.
During the War, many men were away
fighting, and because of this women
were called upon to do work that
was earlier considered men’s work.
Many women began organising and
managing different kinds of work.
When people saw this they began
to wonder why they had created so
many unfair stereotypes about women
and what they were capable of doing.
So women began to be seen as being
equally capable of making decisions.
The suffragettes demanded the right
to vote for all women and to get
their demands heard they chained
themselves to railings in public places.
Many suffragettes were imprisoned and
went on hunger strikes,and they had
to be fed by force. American women got
the right to vote in 1920 while women
in the UK got to vote on the same terms
as men some years later, in 1928.

election process. These representatives
meet and make decisions for the entire
population. These days a government
cannot call itself democratic unless it
allows what is known as universal adult
franchise. This means that all adults in
the country are allowed to vote.
But it was not always like this. Can
you believe that there was a time when
governments did not allow women and
the poor to participate in elections?
In their earliest forms governments
allowed only men who owned property
and were educated, to vote. This meant
that women, the poor, the property-less
and the uneducated were not allowed
to vote. The country was governed by
the rules and regulations that these
few men made!

In India, before Independence,
only a small minority was allowed to
vote and they therefore came together
to determine the fate of the majority.
Several people including Gandhiji
were shocked at the unfairness of this
practice and demanded that all adults
have the right to vote. This is known as
universal adult franchise.
Writing in the journal Young India in
1931, Gandhiji said, “I cannot possibly
bear the idea that a man who has got
wealth should have the vote, but that a
man who has got character but no
wealth or literacy should have no vote,
or that a man who works honestly by
the sweat of his brow day in and day
out should not have the vote for the
crime of being a poor man…”.
