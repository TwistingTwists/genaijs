Chapter 5

Rural
Administration

There are more than six lakh villages in India.
Taking care of their needs for water, electricity,
road connections, is not a small task. In addition
to this, land records have to be maintained
and conflicts too need to be dealt with. A large
machinery is in place to deal with all this. In
this chapter we will look at the work of two rural
administrative officers in some detail.

Mohan was angry but also a little
frightened. Raghu’s family owned many
fields and besides, his uncle was also
the Sarpanch of the village. But even
so, he plucked up courage and went to
Raghu’s house.
A heated argument followed. Raghu
refused to accept that he had moved
the bund. He called one of his helpers
and they began shouting at Mohan and
beating him up. The neighbours heard
the commotion and rushed to the spot
where Mohan was being beaten up.
They took him away.

A Quarrel in the Village

M

ohan is a farmer. His family owns
a small agricultural field, which
they have been farming for many
years. Next to his field is Raghu’s land
which is separated from his by a small
boundary called a bund.
One morning Mohan noticed that
Raghu had shifted the bund by a few
feet. By doing so, he had managed to
take over some of Mohan’s land, and
increased the size of his own field.

He was badly hurt on his head and
hand. He was given first aid by one of
his neighbours. His friend, who also ran
the village post-office, suggested that
they go to the local police station and
file a report. Others were doubtful if this
was a good idea because they felt they
would waste a lot of money and nothing
would come out of it. Some people said
that Raghu’s family would have already
contacted the police station.
After much discussion it was
decided that Mohan would go to the
police station along with some of the
neighbours who had seen the incident.

Area of the Police Station
On the way to the police station one of
the neighbours asked, “Why don’t we
spend some more money and go to the
main police station in the town?”
“It is not a question of money. We
can register the case only in this police
station because our village comes in its
area of work,” explained Mohan.
Every police station has an area that
comes under its control. All persons in
that area can report cases or inform the
police about any theft, accident, injury,
fight, etc. It is the responsibility of the
police of that station to enquire, to
investigate and take action on the cases
within its area.
1. If there is a theft in your house
which police station would you go
to register your complaint?
2. What was the dispute between
Mohan and Raghu?
3. Why was Mohan worried about
picking a quarrel with Raghu?
4. Some people said Mohan should
report the matter to the police and
others said he should not. What
were the arguments they gave?

The work at the Police Station
When they reached the police station
Mohan went to the person in charge
(Station House Officer or S.H.O.) and
told him what had happened. He
also said that he wanted to give the
complaint in writing. The S.H.O rudely
brushed him aside saying that he
couldn’t be bothered to waste his time
writing down minor complaints and

then investigating them. Mohan showed
him his injuries but the S.H.O did not
believe him.
Mohan was puzzled and did not
know what to do. He was not sure why
his complaint was not being recorded.
He went and called his neighbours into
the office. They argued strongly that
Mohan had been beaten up in front of
them and had they not rescued him he

police station through a skit.

differently?

would have been injured very seriously.
They insisted that the case be registered.
Finally the officer agreed. He asked
Mohan to write down his complaint and

also told the people that he would send
a constable the next day to investigate
the incident.
Maintenance of Land Records
You saw that Mohan and Raghu were
arguing heatedly whether the common
boundary of their fields had been
shifted. Isn’t there a way by which
they could have settled this dispute in
a peaceful manner? Are there records
that show who owns what land in the
village? Let’s find out how this is done.
Measuring
land
and
keeping
land records is the main work of the
Patwari. The Patwari is known by
different names in different states
- in some villages such officers are
called Lekhpal, in others Kanungo or

Karamchari or Village Officer etc. We
will refer to this officer as Patwari.
Each Patwari is responsible for a group
of villages. The Patwari maintains and
updates the records of the village.
The map and the corresponding
details from the register on the next
page are a small part of the records
kept by the Patwari.
The Patwari usually has ways of
measuring agricultural fields. In some
places a long chain is used. In the
above instance the Patwari would have
measured both Mohan’s and Raghu’s
fields and compared them with the
measurements on the map. If they did
not match then it would be clear that
the boundary of the fields has been
changed.
Find out the term used for the Patwari
in your state.
If you live in a rural area find out:
How many villages does the Patwari of
your area maintain land records of?
How do people in the village contact
him/her?

The Patwari is also responsible
for organising the collection of land
revenue from the farmers and providing
information to the government about the
crops grown in this area. This is done
from the records that are kept, and this
is why it’s important for the Patwari to
regularly update these. Farmers may
change the crops grown on their fields
or someone may dig a well somewhere,

The Khasra record of the Patwari gives you information regarding the map given
below. It identifies which plot of land is owned by whom. Look at both the records and

and keeping track of all this is the
work of the revenue department
of the government. Senior people
in this department supervise the
Patwari’s work.
All states in India are divided
into districts. For managing matters
relating to land these districts are
further sub-divided. These subdivisions of a district are known
by different names such as tehsil,
taluka, etc. At the head is the
District Collector and under her are
the revenue officers, also known
as tehsildars. They have to hear
disputes. They also supervise the
work of the Patwaris and ensure that
records are properly kept and land
revenue is collected. They make sure
that the farmers can easily obtain a
copy of their record, students can
obtain their caste certificates etc.
The Tehsildar’s office is where land
disputes are also heard.

Farmers often require a copy of their land’s
record together with a map, as shown in
the previous illustration. They have a right
to this information. They may have to pay a
small fee for this.
However, this information is not easily made
available and farmers sometimes have to
face many problems to get it. In some states,
records are now being computerised and also
kept at the Panchayat office so that they are
more easily available and regularly updated.
When do you think farmers may require a
copy of this record? Study the following
situations and identify the cases in which
these records would be necessary and why.
* A farmer wants to buy a plot of land from
another.
* A farmer wants to sell her produce to
another.
* A farmer wants a loan from the bank to dig
a well in her land.
* A farmer wants to purchase fertilizers for
his field.
* A farmer wants to divide his property
among his children.

A daughter’s wish
Father inherited our house
from his father
And everyone says he’ll
leave it to brother
But what about me and my
mother?
To expect a share in my
father’s home,
Is not very womanly, I am
told.
But I really want a place of
my own,
Not dowry of silk and gold.

A New Law
(Hindu Succession Amendment Act,
2005)
Often when we think of farmers who
own land, we think of men. Women are
seen as people who work on the fields,
but not as people who own agricultural
land. Till recently in some states Hindu
women did not get a share in the family’s
agricultural land. After the death of the
father his property was divided equally
only among his sons.
Recently, the law was changed. In
the new law sons, daughters and their
mothers in Hindu families can get an
equal share in the land. The same
law will apply to all states and union
territories of the country.

This law will benefit a large number
of women. For example Sudha is the
eldest daughter of an agricultural
family. She is married and lives in a
neighbouring village. After her father’s
death Sudha often comes to help her
mother with the farming work.
Her mother has asked the Patwari
to transfer the land and enter her name
along with the names of all the children
in his record.
Sudha’s
mother
confidently
organises the farming with the help
of the younger brother and sister.
Similarly Sudha also lives with the
assurance that if she ever has a
problem she can always depend upon
her share of the land.

Other Public Services - A survey
This chapter has looked at some of the administrative work of the
government, especially for rural areas. The first example related to
maintaining law and order and the second to maintaining land records.
In the first case we examined the role of the police and in the second that
of the Patwari. This work is supervised by other people in the department,
such as the Tehsildar or the Superintendent of Police. We have also seen
how people use these services, and some of the problems that they face.
These services have to be used and made to function according to the
laws that have been framed for them. You have probably seen many
other public services and facilities provided by various departments of
the government.
Do the following exercise for your village/by visiting a nearby village or
looking at your own area.
List the public services in the village/area such as: the milk society, the
fair price shop, the bank, the police station, the agricultural society for
seeds and fertiliser, the post office or sub post office, the anganwadi,
crèche, government school/s, health centre or government hospital etc.
Collect information on three public services and discuss with your teacher
how improvements can be made in their functioning. One example has
been worked out.
