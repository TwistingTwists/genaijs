Rural
Livelihoods

In the first chapter we looked at the many kinds of
diversity in our lives. We also explored how living in
different regions has an effect on the work people
do, the kinds of plants, trees, crops or things that
become important to them. In this chapter we will
look at the different ways in which people earn
their living in villages. And here too, as in the first
two chapters, we will examine whether people
have equal opportunities to earn a living. We will
look at the similarities in their life situations and
the problems that they face.

1. Describe the work that you see people doing in the above
pictures.
2. Identify the different types of work that are related to farming
and those that are not. List these in a table.
3. In your notebook draw some pictures of work that you have
seen people do in rural areas and write a few sentences that
describe the work

Kalpattu village

alpattu is a village that’s close
to the sea coast in Tamil Nadu.
People here do many kinds of work.
As in other villages, here too there
is non-farm work such as making
baskets,
utensils,
pots,
bricks,
bullock-carts etc.
There are people who provide
services such as blacksmiths, nurses,
teachers,
washermen,
weavers,
barbers, cycle repair mechanics and
so
on.
There
are
also
some
shopkeepers and traders. In the main
street, which looks like a bazaar, you

and mysorepak in the evening. Near
the teashops in a corner lives a
blacksmith family whose home serves
as their workshop. Next to their home
is a cycle hire and repair shop. Two
families earn a living by washing
clothes. There are some people
who go to the nearby town to work
as construction workers and lorry
drivers.
The village is surrounded by low
hills. Paddy is the main crop that
is grown in irrigated lands. Most of
the families earn a living through
agriculture.
There
are
some
coconut groves around.
Cotton, sugar cane and
plantain are also grown,
and there are mango
orchards. Let us now
meet some people who
work in the fields in
Kalpattu and see what
we can learn about
farming from them.

Transplanting paddy is back-breaking work.

as tea shops, grocery shops, barber

Thulasi
All of us here work on
Ramalingam’s
land.
He has twenty acres
of paddy fields in
Kalpattu. Even before I was married
I used to work on paddy fields in my
parental village. I work from 8.30 in
the morning till 4.30 in the evening
and Karuthamma, Ramalingam’s wife,
supervises us.

the farm he finds work outside, either
loading sand from the river or stone
from the quarry nearby. This is sent
by truck to be used in nearby towns to
make houses.

This is one of the few times in the
year that I find regular work. Now I
am transplanting the paddy, when the
plants have grown a bit Ramalingam
will call us again for weeding and then
finally once again for the harvesting.

Apart from working on the land, I
do all the tasks at home. I cook food for
my family, clean the house and wash
clothes. I go with other women to the
nearby forest to collect firewood. About
one kilometre away we have a village
borewell from where I fetch water. My
husband helps in getting materials such
as groceries for the house.

When I was young I could do this
work with no difficulty. But now as I
grow older I find bending for long
hours with my feet in water very painful.
Ramalingam pays Rs 40 per day. This
is a little less than what labourers get
in my home village, but I come here
because I can depend on him to call me
whenever there is work. Unlike others,
he does not go looking for cheaper labour
from other villages.

Our school-going daughters are the
joy of our lives. Last year, one of them
fell ill and had to be taken to the hospital
in town. We had to sell our cow to pay
back the money we borrowed from
Ramalingam for her treatment.

Based on the above diagram would
you say that Thulasi earns money
throughout the year?

1. Describe the work that
Thulasi does. How is it
different from the work
Raman does?
2. Thulasi gets paid very little
money for the work she
does. Why do you think
agricultural labourers like
her are forced to accept low
wages?
3. In what ways would her way
of earning a living have been
different if Thulasi owned
some farm land? Discuss.
4. What are the crops grown in
your region or nearby rural
area? What kinds of work do
agricultural labourers do?

Rural Livelihoods / 63

As you saw in Thulasi’s story poor
families in rural areas often spend a
lot of time every day collecting
firewood, getting water and grazing
their cattle.
Even though they do not earn any
money from these activities they have
to do them for the household. The
family needs to spend time doing this
as they are not able to survive on the
little money they earn.
Nearly two-fifth of all rural families
are agricultural labourers in our
country. There are some who have
small plots of land while others like
Thulasi are landless.
Not being able to earn money
throughout the year forces people
in many rural areas to travel long
distances in search of work. This
travel, or migration, takes place during
particular seasons.
Sekar
We have to carry this paddy to our
house. My family has just finished

harvesting our field. We don’t own
much land, only two acres. We manage
to do all the work on our own. At
times, especially during the harvest I
take the help of other small farmers
and in turn help them harvest their
field.
The trader gave me seeds and
fertilisers as a loan. To pay back this
loan I have to sell my paddy to him at
a somewhat lower price than what I
would get in the market. He has sent
his agent to remind farmers who have
taken loans that they will sell the paddy
only to him.
I will probably get 60 bags of paddy
from my field. Some of this I will sell to
settle the loan. The rest will be used in
my home. But whatever I have will last
only eight months. So I need to earn
some money. I work in Ramalingam’s
rice mill. Here I help him collect paddy
from other farmers in the neighbouring
villages.
We also have a hybrid cow, whose
milk we sell in the local milk cooperative.
This way we get a little extra money for
our everyday needs.
On being in Debt
As you’ve read above, very often
farmers like Sekar need to borrow
money to purchase basic things
like seeds, fertilisers and pesticides.
Often they borrow this money from
moneylenders. If the seeds are not of
good quality or pests attack their crop
there can be a major crop failure.

64 / Social and Political Life
The crops can also be
ruined if the monsoon does not
bring enough rain. When this
happens farmers sometimes
are unable to pay back their
loans. And, for the family to
survive, they may even have
to borrow more money. Soon
the loan becomes so large that
no matter what they earn,
they are unable to repay.
This is when we can say
they are caught in debt. In
recent years this has become
a major cause of distress
among farmers. In some areas
this has also resulted in many
farmers committing suicide.

Transplanted paddy growing in a few of Ramalingam’s
20 acres. A result of hard labour performed by agricultural
workers like Thulasi.

1. What work does Sekar’s family do?
Why do you think Sekar does not
usually employ labourers for doing
farming work?
2. Why does Sekar not go to the town
market to get a better price for his
paddy?
3. Sekar’s sister Mina had also taken
a loan from the trader. She does not
want to sell her paddy to him but
she will pay back her loan. Write
an imaginary conversation between
Mina and the trader’s agent and the
arguments given by each person.
4. What are the similarities and
differences between Sekar’s
and
Thulasi’s lives? Your answer could
be based on the land that they have,
their need to work on the land that
belongs to others, or loans that they
need and their earnings.

Ramalingam and Karuthamma
In addition to land, Ramalingam’s
family owns a rice mill and a shop
selling seeds, pesticides etc. For the rice
mill they used some of their own money
and also borrowed from the government
bank. They buy paddy from within the
village and from surrounding villages.
The rice that is produced in the mill is
sold to traders in nearby towns. This
gives them a substantial income.
Read again Sekar’s and Thulasi’s
accounts. What do they say about
Ramalingam, the large farmer?
Together with what you have read
fill in the details below:
1. How much land does he have?
2. What does Ramalingam do with
the paddy grown on his land?
3. Apart from
does he earn?

Agricultural Labourers and Farmers
in India

Terrace Farming in Nagaland
This is a village called Chizami
which is in Phek district in
Nagaland. The people of this
village belong to the Chakhesang
community. They do ‘terrace’
cultivation.
This means that the land on a hill
slope is made into flat plots and
carved out in steps. The sides of
each plot are raised in order to
retain water. This allows water to
stand in the field, which is best
for rice cultivation.
The people of Chizami have their
own individual fields. But, they
also work collectively in each
other’s fields. They form groups
of six or eight and take an entire
mountainside to clean the weeds
on it.
Each group eats together once
their work for the day is over.
This goes on for several days
until the work is completed.

In
Kalpattu
village
there
are
agricultural labourers like Thulasi,
and many small farmers like Sekar,
and a few big farmers like Ramalingam.
In India nearly two out of every
five rural families are agricultural
labourer families. All of them depend
on the work they do on other people’s
fields to earn a living. Many of them
are landless and others may own very
small plots of land.
In the case of small farmers like
Sekhar their land is barely enough
to meet their needs. In India 80 per
cent of farmers belong to this group.
Only 20 per cent of India’s farmers are
like Ramalingam. These large farmers
cultivate most of the land in the
villages. A large part of their produce
is sold in the market. Many of them
have started other businesses such as
shops, moneylending, trading, small
factories etc.
From the figures given above
would you say that a majority of
the country’s farmers are quite
poor? What do you think can be
done to change this situation?

We have looked at farming in
Kalpattu. Apart from farming, many
people in rural areas depend upon
collection from the forest, animal
husbandry, dairy produce, fishing etc.
For example, in some villages in

central India, both farming
and collection from the
forest
are
important
sources
of
livelihood.
Collecting mahua, tendu
leaves, honey, to be sold
to traders, is an important
source
of
additional
income.
Similarly selling milk
to the village cooperative
society or taking milk to
the nearby town may be the
main source of livelihood
for some families. In the
coastal areas, we find fishing villages.
Let us find out more about the lives of a
fishing family by reading about Aruna
and Paarivelan who live in Pudupet, a
village close to Kalpattu

Aruna and Paarivelan
Not very far from Kalpattu is the
village of Pudupet. People here earn
their living by fishing. Their houses
are close to the sea and one finds rows

lying around. At about
7 o’clock in the morning
there is a lot of activity
on the beach. This is the
time when the catamarans
return with their catch
and women gather to buy
and sell fish.
My husband Paarivelan,
my brother and my brotherin-law returned late today.
I was very worried. They
go to the sea together in our
catamaran. They said they
were caught in a storm. I
have kept aside some fish
for the family. I will auction
the rest. The money I get

from the auction will be divided into
four shares. One each for each person
who went fishing and the fourth one
is for the equipment. Since we own the
catamaran, engine and nets, we get that
share too. We have taken a loan from a
bank and purchased an engine, which
is fixed on to the catamaran. Now they
can go far into the sea so that they can
get a better catch.
The women who buy fish here will
carry them in baskets to be sold in
nearby villages. Then there are others
like traders who buy for the shops in
the town. I’ll only finish this auction by
noon. In the evening my husband and
our relatives will untangle and repair our
nets. Early tomorrow morning around 2
a.m. they will set out to sea again. Every
year, for at least about four months
during the monsoon, they cannot go to
the sea because this is when the fish
breed. During these months we survive
by borrowing from the trader. Because
of this, later on we are forced to sell
the fish to that trader, and cannot do
our auction. Those lean months are the
most difficult. Last year we suffered a
lot because of the tsunami.
Rural Livelihoods
People in rural areas earn their living in
various ways. Some work on farms while
others earn their living on non- farm
activities. Working on farms involves
operations such as preparing the
land, sowing, weeding and harvesting
of crops. We depend on nature for
the growth of these crops. Hence life

1. Why do both Sekar’s and
Aruna’s families have to borrow?
What similarities and differences
do you find?
2. Have you heard of tsunami?
What is this and what damage
do you think it might have done
to the life of fishing families like
Aruna’s?
revolves around certain seasons. People
are busy during sowing and harvesting
and less so at other times. Rural people
in different regions of the country grow
different crops. However, we do find
similarities in their life situations and
in the problems that they face.
How people are able to survive or
earn will depend upon the land that
they cultivate. Many depend on these
lands for work as labourers. Most
farmers grow crops both for their own
requirements and also to sell in the
market. Some have to sell to traders
from whom they have borrowed money.
For their survival, many families need
to borrow money for their work or when
no work is available. There are some
families in rural areas which thrive
on large acres of lands, business and
other activities. However, most small
farmers, agricultural labourers, fishing
families, crafts persons in the villages
do not find enough work to keep them
employed throughout the year.

QUESTIONS
1. You have probably noticed that people in Kalpattu are engaged in a
variety of non-farm work. List five of these.
2. List the different types of people you read about in Kalpattu who
depend on farming. Who is the poorest among them and why?
3. Imagine you are a member of a fishing family and you are discussing
whether to take a loan from the bank for an engine. What would you
say?
4. Poor rural labourers like Thulasi often do not have access to good
medical facilities, good schools, and other resources. You have read
about inequality in the first unit of this text. The difference between
her and Ramalingam is one of inequality. Do you think this is a fair
situation? What do you think can be done? Discuss in class.
5. What do you think the government can do to help farmers like Sekar
when they get into debt? Discuss.
