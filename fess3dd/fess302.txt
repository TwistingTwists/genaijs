Chapter 2

Diversity and
Discrimination

In the previous chapter you have discussed the
meanings of diversity. Sometimes people who are
‘different’ from others are teased, laughed at or
not included in a certain activity or group. We feel
hurt, angry, helpless or sad when friends or others
treat us in such ways. Have you ever wondered
why this happens?
In this chapter we will try and explore how such
experiences are related to the society we live in. We
will look at how they are connected to the inequalities
that exist around us.

Difference and Prejudice

T

here are many things that make
us what we are – how we live, the
languages we speak, what we eat, wear,
the games we play and the things we
celebrate. All of these are influenced
both by the geography and history of
the place where we live.
You will get an idea of how diverse
India is if you look even briefly at the
following statement:
There are eight major religions in
the world. Every single one of them
is practised in India. We have more

than 1600 languages that are people’s
mother tongues, and there are more
than a hundred dance forms.
Yet this diversity is not always
celebrated. This is because we feel safe
and secure with people who look, talk,
dress and think like us.
Sometimes when we meet people
who are very different from us we may
find them strange and unfamiliar. At
times we may not understand or know
the reasons why they are different from
us. People also form certain attitudes
and opinions about others who are not
like them.

Prejudice
Look at the statements below that you
believed to be true about rural and
urban life in India. Tick mark those
that you agree with.
Do you have a prejudice against rural
or urban people? Find out if this
is shared by others and discuss
the reasons why people have these
prejudices.
Can you list some of the prejudices
that you have noticed around you.
How do they affect the ways in which
people treat each other?

On Rural People
More than 50% of all Indians live in
villages.
People in villages do not like to use
modern technology.
In peak harvesting and plantation
season, families spend 12 to 14
hours working in the fields.
Villagers are forced to migrate to
cities in search of work.

On Urban People
Life in the city is easy. People here
are spoilt and lazy.
In cities families spend very little
time with each other.
People in cities only care about
money, not about people.
Living in a city is expensive. A large
part of people’s earnings is spent on
rent and transport.

Some of these statements see
villagers as ignorant and see people
in cities as money-minded and lazy.
When our opinions about certain
people are always negative – seeing
them as lazy, stingy – as some of
these statements, then these become
prejudices that we carry about them.
Prejudice means to judge other
people negatively or see them as
inferior. When we think that only one
particular way is the best and right
way to do things we often end up not
respecting others, who may prefer to
do things differently. For example,
if we think English is the best
language and other languages are not
important, we are judging these other
languages negatively. As a result, we
might not respect people who speak
languages other than English.
We can be prejudiced about many
things: people’s religious beliefs, the
colour of their skin, the region they
come from, the accent they speak in,
the clothes they wear etc. Often, our
prejudices about others are so strong
that we don’t want to form friendships
with them. At times, we may even act
in ways that hurt them.

Creating Stereotypes
All of us are familiar with gender
differences. What does it mean to be a
boy or a girl? Many of you would say,
“We are born as boys and girls. It is a
given. What is there to think about?”
Let’s see if this is the case.
Arrange the statements given below in
these two sections, according to what
you think is appropriate for the section.
They are well behaved.
They are soft spoken and gentle.
They are physically strong .
They are naughty.
They are good at dance and painting.
They don’t cry.
They are rowdy.
They are good at sport.
They are good at cooking.
They are emotional.

Now check, with your teacher’s help, who has put which statement
where. Find out and discuss people’s reasons for doing this. Are the
qualities you put in for boys something that boys are born with?

If we take the statement ‘’ They don’t
cry”, you’ll see that this is a quality
that is generally associated with boys
and men. As babies or children when
boys fall and hurt themselves, their
parents and other family members
often console them by saying “Don’t
cry. You are a boy. Boys are brave,

they don’t cry.” As children grow up
they start believing that boys do not
cry so that even if a boy feels like
crying he stops himself from doing so.
He also believes that crying is a sign
of weakness. So, even though both
boys and girls sometimes want to cry,
especially if they are angry or in pain,

The children you see in the
illustrations here were seen
as ‘disabled’. This term has
been changed and now the
term used is ‘children with
special
needs’.
Common
stereotypes about them are
given in large letters. Their
own feelings and thoughts too
are given.
Discuss what these children
are saying about stereotypes
regarding them and why.
Do you think children with
special needs should be a
part of regular schools or
study in a separate school?
Give reasons for your answer.

as they grow older boys learn or teach
themselves not to cry. If a grown boy
cries, then he feels that others will
either tease him or laugh at him, and
so he stops himself from doing so in
front of others.

skills that are different from others.
They fit large numbers of people into
only one pattern or type. Stereotypes
affect all of us as they prevent us from
doing certain things, that we might
otherwise be good at.

This is the way boys are and this is
how girls are: these are statements we
hear constantly and accept without
even thinking, and we start believing
that each one of us must behave
accordingly. We fit all boys and all girls
into an image that society creates
around us.

Inequality and Discrimination
Discrimination happens when people
act on their prejudices or stereotypes.
If you do something to put other people
down, if you stop them from taking
part in certain activities and taking up
jobs, or stop them from living in certain
neighbourhoods, prevent them from
taking water from the same well or hand
pump, or not allow them to drink tea
in the same cups or glasses as others,
you are discriminating against them.

You can take other statements such
as They are soft and gentle or
They are well behaved and discuss
how these are applied to girls. Do
girls possess these qualities at birth
or do they learn such behaviour
from others? What do you think
about girls who are not soft and
gentle and those who are naughty?

When we fix people into one
image we create a stereotype. When
people say that those who belong to a
particular country, religion, sex, race
or economic background are “stingy,”
“lazy,” “criminal” or “dumb,” they are
using stereotypes. There are stingy and
generous people everywhere, in every
country, in every religion, in every
group whether rich or poor, male or
female. And just because some people
are like that it is not fair to think that
everyone will be the same.
Stereotypes stop us from looking at
each person as a unique individual with
his or her own special qualities and

Discrimination can take place
because of several reasons. You
probably recall from the previous
chapter that Samir Ek and Samir Do
were different from each other in many
ways. For example, they belonged to
different religions. This is an aspect
of diversity. However, this diversity
can also be a source of discrimination.
Groups of people who may speak a
certain language, follow a particular
religion, live in specific regions etc.,
may be discriminated against as their
customs or practices may be seen as
inferior.
Another difference between the
two Samirs was in their economic
backgrounds. Samir Do was poor. This
difference, as you have read earlier, is
not a form of diversity but of inequality.
People who are poor do not have the

nation, which took place in 1901 when
he was just nine years old. He had gone
with his brothers and cousins to meet
his father in Koregaon which is now in
Maharashtra.
Long did we wait, but no one turned
up. An hour elapsed and the stationmaster came to enquire. He asked us for
our tickets. We showed them to him. He
asked us why we tarried. We told him
that we were bound for Koregaon and
that we were waiting for father or his
servant to come, but that neither had
turned up and that we did not know
how to reach Koregaon.
We were well-dressed children.
From our dress or talk no one could
make out that we were children of
the untouchables. Indeed the stationmaster was quite sure we were
Brahmin children and was extremely
touched at the plight in which he found
us. As is usual among the Hindus, the
stationmaster asked us who we were.
Without a moment’s thought I blurted
out that we were Mahars. (Mahar is
one of the communities which were

treated as untouchables in the Bombay
Presidency.) He was stunned. His
face underwent a sudden change. We
could see that he was overpowered by
a strange feeling of repulsion. As soon
as he heard my reply, he went away to
his room and we stood where we were.
Fifteen to twenty minutes elapsed; the
sun was almost setting. Our father
had not turned up nor had he sent his
servant, and now the stationmaster had
also left us. We were quite bewildered,
and the joy and happiness, which we
felt at the beginning of the journey, gave
way to a feeling of extreme sadness.
After half an hour the stationmaster
returned and asked us what we
proposed to do. We said that if we could
get a bullock-cart on hire we would go to
Koregaon, and if it was not very far we
would like to start straightway. There
were many bullock-carts plying for hire.
But my reply to the station master that
we were Mahars had gone round among
the cart men and not one of them was
prepared to suffer being polluted and to
demean himself carrying passengers
of the untouchable classes. We were
prepared to pay double the fare but we
found that money did not work. The
stationmaster, who was negotiating on
our behalf, stood silent, not knowing
what to do.

Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar (1891-1956)
is considered the father of the Indian
Constitution and is also the best known
leader of the Dalits. Dr Ambedkar fought
for the rights of the Dalit community.
He was born into the Mahar caste,
which was considered untouchable.
The Mahars were poor, owned no land
and children born to them also had to
do the work their parents did. They
lived in spaces outside the main village
and were not allowed into the village.
Dr Ambedkar was the first person
from his caste who completed his
college education and went to England
to become a lawyer. He encouraged
Dalits to send their children to school
and college. He also urged Dalits to
take on different kinds of government
jobs in order to move out of the caste
system. He led many efforts of Dalits to
gain entry into temples. Later in life he
converted to Buddhism in his search
for a religion that treated
a l l
members equally. Dr
Ambedkar
believed
that Dalits must fight
the caste system
and work towards
a society based on
respect
not
just
for a few but for all
persons.

Striving for Equality
The struggle for freedom from British
rule also included within it the struggle
of large groups of people who not only
fought against the British but also
fought to be treated more equally.
Dalits, women, tribals and peasants
fought against the inequalities they
experienced in their lives.
As pointed out earlier, many Dalits
organised themselves to gain entry
into temples. Women demanded that
they should have as much a right to

education as men did. Peasants and
tribals fought to release themselves
from the grasp of the moneylender
and the high interest they were
charged.
When India became a nation in
1947 our leaders too were concerned
about the different kinds of
inequalities that existed. Those who
wrote the Constitution of India, a
document that laid out the rules by
which the nation would function,
were aware of the ways in which
discrimination had been practised
in our society and how people
had struggled against this. Many
leaders of these struggles such as
Dr Ambedkar had also fought for the
rights of the Dalits.
So these leaders set out a vision and
goals in the Constitution to ensure that
all the people of India were considered
equal. This equality of all persons is
seen as a key value that unites us all
as Indians. Everyone has equal rights
and opportunities. Untouchability is
seen as a crime and has been legally
abolished by law. People are free to
choose the kind of work they wish to
do. Government jobs are open to all
people. In addition, the Constitution
also placed responsibility on the
government to take specific steps to
realise this right to equality for poor
and other such marginal communities.

The writers of the Constitution also
said that respect for diversity was a
significant element in ensuring equality.
They felt that people must have the
freedom to follow their religion, speak
their language, celebrate their festivals
and express themselves freely. They

Some of the members who wrote the
Constitution of India.

said that no one language, religion or
festival should become compulsory
for all to follow. They said that the
government must treat all religions
equally.
Therefore, India became a secular
country where people of different
religions and faiths have the freedom
to practise and follow their religion
without any fear of discrimination.
This is seen as an important element of
our unity – that we all live together and
respect one other.
