**2. What is a Mineral?**

**(ii) According to geologists, what is a key characteristic of a mineral?**
(a) It is always found in a liquid state.
(b)  It is made from synthetic materials.
(c)  It has a definable internal structure. 
(d)  It is always found in large deposits.

**Answer: (c) It has a definable internal structure.** 
**Explanation:**  Minerals have a specific, repeating arrangement of atoms, which gives them their unique properties.

**3. Formation of Minerals**

**(iii)  How are minerals primarily formed in igneous and metamorphic rocks?**
(a) Through the evaporation of ocean water.
(b)  By the weathering and erosion of existing rocks.
(c)  From the cooling and solidifying of molten material. 
(d)  From the accumulation of plant matter over millions of years.

**Answer: (c) From the cooling and solidifying of molten material.** 
**Explanation:** Igneous and metamorphic rocks are formed from magma or lava, which contain various minerals that crystallize as they cool. 

**4. Mode of Occurrence**

**(iv)  Which type of mineral deposit is typically found in valley floors and at the base of hills?**
(a)  Veins and Lodes
(b)  Beds or Layers
(c)  Placer deposits 
(d)  Residual deposits

**Answer: (c) Placer deposits** 
**Explanation:** Placer deposits are formed by the erosion and deposition of heavier minerals, often found in riverbeds and streambeds.

**5. Distribution of Minerals in India**

**(v)  Which of the following is the most important industrial iron ore used in India?**
(a)  Magnetite
(b)  Hematite 
(c)  Bauxite
(d)  Limestone

**Answer: (b) Hematite**
**Explanation:** Hematite is the most abundant and widely used iron ore for steel production. 

**6. Hazards of Mining**

**(vi)  What is a significant environmental consequence of mining activities?**
(a)  Increased biodiversity
(b)  Improved air quality 
(c)  Land degradation 
(d)  Reduced water pollution

**Answer: (c) Land degradation**
**Explanation:** Mining often leads to soil erosion, habitat destruction, and the release of harmful chemicals into the environment.

**7. Conventional Sources of Energy**

**(vii)  What is the most abundant fossil fuel used in India for power generation?**
(a)  Petroleum
(b)  Natural gas
(c)  Coal 
(d)  Uranium

**Answer: (c) Coal** 
**Explanation:** Coal is the dominant fossil fuel in India for electricity production and other industries.

**8. Non-Conventional Sources of Energy**

**(viii)  Which non-conventional energy source relies on the harnessing of heat from the Earth's interior?**
(a)  Solar energy
(b)  Wind energy
(c)  Tidal energy 
(d)  Geothermal energy

**Answer: (d) Geothermal energy** 
**Explanation:** Geothermal energy utilizes the heat from deep within the Earth to generate electricity. 

**9. Conservation of Energy Resources**

**(ix)  What is a key strategy for promoting sustainable energy development?**
(a)  Increasing dependence on fossil fuels. 
(b)  Promoting energy conservation.
(c)  Expanding mining operations.
(d)  Restricting use of renewable energy sources.

**Answer: (b) Promoting energy conservation.**
**Explanation:**  Conserving energy reduces demand and helps ensure long-term sustainability of energy resources.
