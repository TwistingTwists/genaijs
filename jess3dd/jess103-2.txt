## MCQs from the Chapter:

**1. Water Scarcity:**

**(i) Which of the following is NOT a direct cause of water scarcity?**

(a) Over-exploitation of groundwater
(b) Excessive use of water in agriculture
(c) Unequal distribution of rainfall
(d) Increase in industrialization

**Answer:** (c) Unequal distribution of rainfall 

**Explanation:** While rainfall distribution is a factor in water availability, it's not a direct cause of scarcity. Scarcity arises from how we use and manage water.

**2. Water Resources Management:**

**(ii) Which of the following is a key objective of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchaee Yojana?**

(a) Promoting organic farming practices
(b) Expanding the area under assured irrigation
(c) Supporting the development of new crop varieties
(d) Providing financial assistance to drought-affected farmers

**Answer:** (b) Expanding the area under assured irrigation

**Explanation:** The scheme aims to ensure reliable irrigation access for all agricultural farms in the country.

**3. Rainwater Harvesting:**

**(iii) What is the primary function of 'Tankas' in Rajasthan?**

(a)  Collecting rainwater for irrigation
(b)  Storing drinking water for household use
(c)  Providing water to cattle 
(d)  Recharging groundwater 

**Answer:** (b) Storing drinking water for household use

**Explanation:** Tankas are underground storage structures used to collect and store rainwater for domestic use, especially in arid regions.

**4. Water Scarcity:**

**(iv)  In which scenario would a region likely experience water scarcity despite abundant rainfall?**

(a) Low population density
(b)  Well-maintained irrigation systems
(c)  High levels of water pollution
(d)  Limited use of groundwater

**Answer:** (c) High levels of water pollution

**Explanation:**  Polluted water becomes unusable, leading to scarcity even if the total water volume is high.

**5. Water Resources Management:**

**(v)  What is a significant environmental concern associated with multi-purpose river projects?**

(a)  Increased groundwater recharge
(b)  Reduced soil erosion
(c)  Fragmentation of river ecosystems
(d)  Promotion of sustainable agriculture

**Answer:** (c) Fragmentation of river ecosystems

**Explanation:**  Dams disrupt the natural flow of rivers, impacting aquatic life and the overall health of ecosystems.

**6. Rainwater Harvesting:**

**(vi)  Which state in India made rooftop rainwater harvesting structures compulsory for all households?**

(a)  Karnataka
(b)  Rajasthan
(c)  Tamil Nadu
(d)  Meghalaya

**Answer:** (c) Tamil Nadu

**Explanation:** Tamil Nadu implemented a policy making rainwater harvesting structures mandatory, emphasizing water conservation.

**7. Water Scarcity:**

**(vii) What is the primary reason why water scarcity is expected to worsen by 2025?**

(a)  Increasing global temperatures
(b)  Climate change impacting rainfall patterns
(c)  Growing population and increasing water demand
(d)  Limited investment in water infrastructure

**Answer:** (c) Growing population and increasing water demand

**Explanation:**  A rising global population will put further pressure on already strained water resources.

**8. Water Resources Management:**

**(viii) Which of the following is NOT a traditional method of water harvesting in India?**

(a)  Khadins
(b)  Tankas
(c)  Bamboo Drip Irrigation
(d)  Guls

**Answer:** (c) Bamboo Drip Irrigation

**Explanation:** Bamboo Drip Irrigation is a modern adaptation of traditional methods using bamboo for water distribution.

**9. Rainwater Harvesting:**

**(ix) What is the main benefit of bamboo drip irrigation systems?**

(a)  Increased water availability for irrigation
(b)  Reduced water wastage and efficient use
(c)  Improved soil quality
(d)  Reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers

**Answer:** (b) Reduced water wastage and efficient use

**Explanation:** Bamboo drip irrigation delivers water directly to plant roots, minimizing loss through evaporation.

**10. Water Scarcity:**

**(x)  Which statement accurately describes the relationship between water scarcity and food security?**

(a)  Water scarcity has no impact on food security.
(b)  Water scarcity increases food security by encouraging farmers to adopt drought-resistant crops.
(c)  Water scarcity hinders food security as it limits agricultural production.
(d)  Water scarcity improves food security by promoting efficient water use in agriculture.

**Answer:** (c) Water scarcity hinders food security as it limits agricultural production.

**Explanation:**  Water is crucial for agriculture, and a lack of water directly impacts food production, posing a threat to food security.
